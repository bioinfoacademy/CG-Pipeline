PREREQUISITES/DEPENDENCIES

This package and its dependencies require approximately XXX GB of free disk space.

The following packages (and their dependencies) are required for the operation of cg_pipeline.

BioPerl (>= 1.6)
NCBI BLAST (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/blast+/)
AMOS (http://amos.sourceforge.net/)
Glimmer3 (http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/glimmer/)
tRNAscan-SE (http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/tRNAscan-SE/)

The following packages are required. However, their installation may present some difficulties, and some parts of the pipeline will still be able to function without them.

InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/InterProScan/)
TMHMM (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/)
SignalP (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/)

INSTALLATION

To install the package, first unpack the archive and type "make" in the resulting directory. This will download and initialize the required databases. The complete process takes about a day.

Next, type "make install" to install the package in your system. By default, the package will install in /opt/cg_pipeline. Because of the size of the databases, they will be moved rather than copied from the current directory, in the hope that the target directory is on the same filesystem.

If you do not have administrator privileges on your system, or if you require a different installation directory, pass the environment variable DESTDIR when running "make install". For example:

make install DESTDIR="${HOME}/cg_pipeline"

Finally, to be able to run cg_pipeline from any directory, add the scripts subdirectory to the PATH variable in your shell, e.g.:

PATH="${PATH}:/opt/cg_pipeline/scripts"


USAGE
